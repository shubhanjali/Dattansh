                            <p>Evolving technologies act as catalysts to this revolution, as they ingest, store, process and visualise data and provide a platform for generating insights that power businesses by adding value to their services. Every business will collect its own version of data that it identifies as ‘relevant’ to a particular problem. How exactly do they determine what comes under the umbrella of relevance and what is to be excluded? What steps does an organization follow in order to reach the insights? How does one deal with the enormity of the data generated? What are the statistical tools that the organizations swear by? What are the conditions under which one machine learning model is preferred over the other? These are a few among the countless questions that Dattansh 2018 aims to answer.With technology advancing at the pace of light years, the world is entering into an era of Big Data. Datafication and accurate analytics for the purpose of extracting meaningful information from the chaotic data will play a huge role in shaping the course of the industries in the years to come. There are tools that enable the quantification of social, political, economic and environmental relationships but the bigger concern remains – have we equipped ourselves with the right skills in order to be a part of this revolution that has been termed as ‘datafication’? Are we truly capable of quantifying the unimaginable.</p>
